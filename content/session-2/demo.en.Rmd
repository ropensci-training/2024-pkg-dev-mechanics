## Reminder from last time

We have a package with a function.

---

## A test

* `use_testthat()`.

* `use_test("time")`: first a simple test, then a snapshot test, then a snapshot of the error.

* `devtools::test()` / test the file on its own via the button.

* `devtools::check()`

:toolbox: repeat the steps!

## GitHub Actions

* `usethis::use_github_action_check_standard()`. Check on the cloud, different operating systems.
