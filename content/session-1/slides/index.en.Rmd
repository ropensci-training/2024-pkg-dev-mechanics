# Package Development

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library("magrittr")
get_pic <- function(id, alt, width) {
  
  info <- httr::GET(
    paste0("https://api.pexels.com/v1/photos/", id),
    httr::add_headers(Authorization = Sys.getenv("PEXELS_KEY"))
  ) %>%
    httr::content()
  download.file(info$src$large, paste0(id, ".jpeg"))
  cat("```{=html}\n")

```{r repair, results="asis", cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE}

## My R package development creds

I really :heart: R package development

* Volunteer editor for [rOpenSci Software Peer Review](https://ropensci.org/software-review).

* At work, maintenance of [rOpenSci dev guide](https://devguide.ropensci.org).

* Created the [R-hub blog](https://blog.r-hub.io).

* Worked on the [HTTP testing in R](https://books.ropensci.org/http-testing/) book.

## My R package development creds

Contributed to

* [pkgdown 2.0.0](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2021/12/pkgdown-2-0-0/) (to produce documentation websites for packages)

* [fledge 0.1.0](https://cynkra.github.io/fledge/) (Smoother change tracking and versioning for R packages)

* [glitter 0.1.0](https://lvaudor.github.io/glitter/) (a SPARQL domain-specific language)

## Why develop an R package?

Easiest way to share code/data/R Markdown templates... with

* (future) you,

* the collaborators you know,

* and the collaborators you don't.

---

## Why learning about package development?

[Jon Calder](https://joncalder.co.za/)'s very good [wording](https://github.com/iandurbach/datasci-fi/tree/master/docs/packages/slides)

* To share code (and data);

* To leverage existing tooling;

* To contribute to other packages.

---

## Who can write a package? YOU!

Susan Johnston's [wise words](https://github.com/susjoh/fibonacci).

* Can you open R or RStudio?

* Can you install a package?

* Have you ever written a function in R?

* Could you _learn_ how to write a function in R?

:arrow_right:  **You can write a package in R!**

---

## Learn about functions

* [Materials from Stephanie Kirmer's R-Ladies East Lansing tutorial](https://github.com/rladies-eastlansing/2021-rfunctions#writing-r-functions)

* [Write your own R functions](https://stat545.com/functions-part1.html), stat 545 course by Jenny Bryan and The STAT 545 TAs;
* [Chapter about functions](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/functions.html) in the book "R for Data Science" by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham;
* [Fun with Functions talk](https://zealous-wiles-e22e83.netlify.app/talk/funwithfunctions/) by Kaylea Haynes, R-Ladies Manchester.

## What is a package?

>  Pour réduire ses craintes, il faut se dire que ce n’est ni plus ni moins qu’un dossier organisé d’une manière contrainte.

> To be less afraid you have to tell yourself that it's simply a folder organized in a constrained way.

[Sébastien Rochette](https://thinkr.fr/transformer-plusieurs-scripts-eparpilles-en-beau-package-r)

## Automation!

```{=html}
{{< figure src="automate_meme.jpg" alt="Small monster saying to automate all the things" caption="Meme image by [Allie Brosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbole_and_a_Half)" >}}
```

---

## Automating... How?

Remember Clippy?

---

## Automating... How?

Get to know an actually useful Clippy, `{usethis}`!

```{=html}
{{< figure src="https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/figures/logo.png" alt="usethis logo, a robot" >}}
```

---

## Why automate? Easier for...

Regular work, teaching, reproducing problems.

```{r wheel, results="asis", cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
get_pic(id = 5446296, alt = "Bike wheel with tools on the floor", 200)
```

---

## Goals for the three sessions

* Get to know (the best :innocent:) tools for package development;

* Learn that there is no magic, only practice and :sparkles: tips :sparkles:.


```{r tiny, results="asis", cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
get_pic(id = 686230, alt = "Bike sign on a bike path, with tree leaves", 300)
```

---

## Website tour

:link: https://rpkgdev-mechanics-2024.netlify.app/

Slides, demo notes, further resources

```{r balance, results="asis", cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
get_pic(id = 3932867, alt = "Small kid on a balance bike", 200)
```

---

## Time for the workshop :bicycle:

Alternating between watching and practicing in breakout rooms.

```{r parkes, results="asis", cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
get_pic(id = 221237, alt = "Two bikes parked", 200)
```
---


## Back from the workshop

`{usethis}` for all the things.

```{r sign, results="asis", cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
get_pic(id = 206040, alt = "Cycle path sign", 400)
```

---

## usethis related content in `.Rprofile`

Like saving the settings of a bike.

No need to adjust the saddle height every time you go for a ride!

---

## Two wheels always turning :bike:

- loading, trying out, editing.

- running (adding) the tests, editing. Next time!


---

## R CMD check (devtools::check())

```{r traffic, results="asis", cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
get_pic(id = 4543112, alt = "Bike traffic light", 300)
```

---

## Questions?

See you at the next package development training?

Prepare questions in advance, send them in advance if you can.
