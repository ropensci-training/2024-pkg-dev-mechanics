Before you start writing packages...

* Set up your system as [explained in the R packages book by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan](https://r-pkgs.org/setup.html). Contact me (Slack message, `maelle@ropensci.org`) if the call to `devtools::has_devel()` gives you an error that puzzles you.

* [Create a GitHub account](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct), [install Git](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git).

* Also connect R with your GitHub account. See [Managing Git(Hub) Credentials](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/git-credentials.html) (and [Managing GitHub credentials from R, difficulty level linux](https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2021-08-08_git-credential-helpers/) if needed :sweat_smile:). Contact me (Slack message, `maelle@ropensci.org`) if the call to `usethis::git git_sitrep()` gives you an error that puzzles you.

* Learn how to write functions. Some useful links:
    * [Write your own R functions](https://stat545.com/functions-part1.html), stat 545 course by Jenny Bryan and The STAT 545 TAs;
    * [Chapter about functions](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/functions.html) in the book "R for Data Science" by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham;
    * [Fun with Functions talk](https://www.kaylea.co.uk/talk/funwithfunctions/) by Kaylea Haynes, R-Ladies Manchester.
    * [Materials from Stephanie Kirmer's tutorial](https://github.com/rladies-eastlansing/2021-rfunctions#writing-r-functions)
